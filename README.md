Game Identity
  32-bit plat-former/dungeon crawler about a soldier fighting through a labyrinth of machines sent to destroy him and all life on the ship he’s on.

Design Pillars
  Escalating power. Claustrophobic. Non-linear choices.

Mechanics
  Game uses rogue-like elements, procedural generated layouts, and a random item system. As you progress further into the ship, enemies become more powerful as the sys_admin prepares to fight you. Power-ups are permanent or multi-use active items that stack infinitely.

Features
  Infinite stacking of items, procedurally generated rooms, random items. A feeling that you could always become stronger, and a chance to acquire a large inventory of stacking items rather quickly.

Interface
  Standard WASD controls for movement, mouse to aim and shoot. Menu and inventory is controlled through GUI elements. Game pad controls will also be added.

Art Style
  Shovel Knight for lighter character designs, Axiom Verge for the limited tile set and beautiful background tiles. Light-hearted feel despite the circumstances, like Isaac.

Music Style / Sound Design
  Sounds should illicit a sense of dread in a way, and boss fights should pick up the sound and create a sense of urgency.
