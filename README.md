<h3>Game Identity:</h3>
  <p>32-bit plat-former/dungeon crawler about a soldier fighting through a labyrinth of machines sent to destroy him and all life on the ship he’s on.

<h3>Design Pillars:</h3>
  <p>Escalating power. Claustrophobic. Non-linear choices.

<h3>Mechanics:</h3>
  <p>Game uses rogue-like elements, procedural generated layouts, and a random item system. As you progress further into the ship, enemies become more powerful as the sys_admin prepares to fight you. Power-ups are permanent or multi-use active items that stack infinitely.

<h3>Features:</h3>
  <p>Infinite stacking of items, procedurally generated rooms, random items. A feeling that you could always become stronger, and a chance to acquire a large inventory of stacking items rather quickly.

<h3>Interface:</h3>
  <p>Standard WASD controls for movement, mouse to aim and shoot. Menu and inventory is controlled through GUI elements. Game pad controls will also be added.

<h3>Art Style:</h3>
  <p>Shovel Knight for lighter character designs, Axiom Verge for the limited tile set and beautiful background tiles. Light-hearted feel despite the circumstances, like Isaac.

<h3>Music Style / Sound Design:</h3>
  <p>Sounds should illicit a sense of dread in a way, and boss fights should pick up the sound and create a sense of urgency.
